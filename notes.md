EDIT :

Ok, it's bigger than i thougth.. it's a whole infra..

there's one host with 20 selenium running only to create user on M$ live and it works.. i saw it 0.0

Then there's 6 hosts with a total of 100 selenium made only to create the FB account with the fresh M$ live account, add photos background, then try to create a business account, then try to spread ads..

it's a bit.. you know.. touchy
